# Crossbow Scoping

Crossbow Scoping is a mod that allows you to attach spyglasses to crossbows!

Right-click on a crossbow while holding a spyglass with the mouse cursor to attach the spyglass to the crossbow.

Crossbows with scopes load projectiles normally, however, when using a loaded crossbow with a scope, the use action will be delegated to the scope.
Instead, to shoot the projectile(s), you now have to press your attack key/button.

This mod (should have) out-of-the-box compatibility with mods that add custom spyglasses and custom crossbow projectiles. Feel free to open an issue on GitHub if you find an exception!
